## 📊 Transparent Pricing Philosophy

We believe in straightforward, value-based pricing:

### Per-Cluster Pricing (Self-Hosted)
**Why per-cluster?**
- Infrastructure cost scales with clusters
- Easy to calculate and budget
- Fair: You pay for what you use

**What counts as a cluster?**
- One Kubernetes cluster = one license
- Includes unlimited nodes, namespaces, and images within that cluster

### Per-Organization Pricing (SaaS)
**Why per-org?**
- We manage infrastructure, you pay for convenience
- Scales with your team size and usage
- Simple: One price, no surprises

### Consumption Pricing (Dynamic Analysis)
**Why consumption?**
- High-value, high-cost feature (sandbox infrastructure)
- Use occasionally? Pay per-analysis ($500-1000 each)
- Use frequently? Get monthly quota (Ultimate tier)
